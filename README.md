CS 340 Grazioso Salvare README

About the Project:
Grazioso Salvare is an international rescue-animal training company. They can identify dogs that would be good for search and rescue training. They paired with five animal shelters in the region to acquire data from those shelters. 

Functionality:
This project visualizes the data of an animal shelter. It allows users to search using filters that fit their desired criteria. Some of these filters include rescue types, preferred breed and preferred age.

Requirements:
•	Python
•	Jupyter Notebook
•	MongoDB
•	Dash Framework

The code uses radio buttons as a filter option. When a user clicks the desired rescue type, they will be shown all the dogs in the database that fit the criteria. The data will be displayed along with a map that shows the animal location and a pi chart that shows how much of each breed makes up the data set.
